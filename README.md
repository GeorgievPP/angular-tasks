# Angular Tasks

Collection of small Angular applications solving different programming tasks.  
Each task is implemented as a **standalone Angular app**, focusing on clean architecture, best practices, and modern Angular features.

This repository is intended for:
- practice
- portfolio
- interview preparation

## 🧠 What You Will Find Here

Each folder represents a separate Angular task with its own setup and README.

The goals of this repository are:
- clean project structure
- clear separation of concerns
- readable and maintainable code
- practical use of Angular features

## 🏗️ Project Philosophy

Across all tasks, the following principles are applied:

- Feature-based structure
- Container (smart) vs presentational components
- Services for state and business logic
- Strong typing with models
- Minimal coupling between components
